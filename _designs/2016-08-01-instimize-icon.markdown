While studying at Make School in 2015, I worked with my friend, [Cassandra Kane][ck-github], to redesign the app icon for her iOS app *[Instimize][instimize-link]*. It's an app that's probably more practical than anything I've made so far, so if you're looking to improve your social influence on Instagram, you can download it [here][instimize-link].

This is what the old icon looked like:

<figure>
    <img class="responsive-icon" src="/images/designs/instimize/instimize-old.png" alt="The old Instimize icon.">
</figure>

Pretty good so far, and it gets the app's message across, but Cassandra and I thought there was room for improvement. Using Sketch, I designed a bunch of icons:

<figure class="lazyload" data-expand="-20">
    <img class="lazyload" data-src="/images/designs/instimize/instimize-designs.png" alt="All the Instimize icon iterations.">
</figure>

After several iterations, we settled on a flat design:

<figure class="lazyload" data-expand="-20">
    <img class="responsive-icon lazyload" data-src="/images/designs/instimize/instimize-final.png" alt="The final Instimize icon design.">
</figure>

You can (and you should!) download Instimize [here][instimize-link].
