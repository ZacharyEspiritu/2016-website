# Overview

From September 2016 to May 2017, I worked as the Layout Editor for *The Owl*, the newspaper of record of Regis High School, my alma mater. While from September 2014 to May 2016 I had worked as the Assistant Layout Editor, this was my first opportunity to design issues myself for publication.

During my tenure as The Owl's Layout Editor, I redesigned overall design elements to ensure each publication had a consistent theme while still improving upon previous issues. Throughout the year, I also advocated for the eventual change from eight-page to twelve-page issues in addition to implementing a new "Student News" column on Page 3 designed to feature student accomplishments that were not included in the main article set.

You can read sample issues that I designed below or view the entirety of Volume 81 of The Owl at [Issuu][issuu-profile].
