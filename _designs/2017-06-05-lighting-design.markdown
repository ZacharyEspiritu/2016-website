From September 2013 to May 2017, I worked in the lighting department for the Regis Repertory, my high school's theatrical production group. From September 2013 to April 2015, I *usually* operated as the Assistant Lighting Technician where I worked in tandem with an upperclassman to design and implement lighting plots (on some occassions, I filled in as a production's Lighting Designer). In May 2015, I shifted to the role of Lighting Designer and Crew Chief *ex-officio*.

During my run in the Regis Repertory, I had the opportunity to work on twelve mainstage productions in addition to providing lighting technical assistance for several smaller performances by the various extracurricular groups at Regis High School.

You can find my technical lighting resume [here][lighting-resume]. You can also view images and videos featuring some of the lighting work I've designed  below.

### *Once On This Island*, Regis Repertory Fall 2016 Production

> A reimagined staging of Once on This Island, placing the musicalâ€™s themes of social prejudice and classism in our modern age.
