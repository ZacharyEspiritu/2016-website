Calenday is a proof-of-concept of a calendar app that focuses on intuitive visualization and navigation with card design. It's an idea I've been toying around with in my head for some time, and I eventually decided I might as well "Sketch" it out.

(I used Sketch to design the mockups. I apologize for my dry sense of humor.)
