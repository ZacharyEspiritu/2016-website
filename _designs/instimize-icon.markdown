While studying at Make School in 2015, I worked with my friend, Cassandra Kane, to redesign the app icon for her iOS app *Instimize*. It's an app that's probably more practical than anything I've made so far, so if you're looking to improve your social influence on Instagram, you can download it [here][instimize-link].

This is what the old icon looked like:

Pretty good so far, and it gets the app's message across, but Cassandra and I thought there was room for improvement. Using Sketch, I designed the following icons:

After several iterations, we settled on a flat design:
