# Overview

[Tile, Tap, Push!][tile-tap-push-website] is a two-player, fast-paced game that's all about reaction time and quick thinking. Tap an endless stream of white tiles faster than your opponent to win!

Tile, Tap, Push! was developed while I was studying at the [Make School Summer Academy][make-school-sa] in 2015. Even though I didn't really know iOS development at the time, I got bored during the tutorial section of the program and decided just to jump right into creating an app for the first time.

The gameplay is simple: two players sit on opposite sides of the screen and race to tap the white tiles on the screen in front of them as fast as possible. Every time a player taps a tile correctly, the dividing line in the center moves towards their opponent, which fills more of the screen with the player's color. However, if a player makes an incorrect tap, the line moves back towards them. The first player to completely fill the screen with their color wins the game.

There's also a single player mode where one player attempts to survive as long as possible against a line that moves down the screen with increasing speed.

# Implementation and Design

I programmed the majority of the app in Swift using the open-source game engine [cocos2d-objc][cocos2d-github]. I also added [Mixpanel][mixpanel] for analytics and Game Center integration for single player mode leaderboards.

I liked the idea of a "rolling" grid for the tiles, so I had the height of each tile row scale up as it approaches the player. This also helped to make it clearer to new players *which* white tile they had to press—before, players would tap any of the white tiles on their side of the screen.

# Result

At the Demo Day at the end of the program, Tile, Tap, Push (along with [Reaction Line][reaction-line-post], another project I worked on while at Make School) won the "Audience Choice" award as voted by the vistors in attendance. As a result, I was able to present both of my projects in front of everyone (approximately 100 people). I also received the "Student Choice Runner-Up" award as selected by my fellow students in the program.
