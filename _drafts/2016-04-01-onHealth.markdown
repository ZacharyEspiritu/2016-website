At [hackBCA III][hackBCA], I teamed up with [Gianluca Rago][gr-website] to create [onHealth][onHealth-website], an online database platform focused on making healthcare data more accessible to all caretakers via a centralized database. As a proof-of-concept, we launched with an app to help Alzhemier's patients.
