During February 2017 â€“ May 2017, in lieu of traditional courses, I participated in the "Social Justice Entrepreneurship" program, where I completed three days of service work and two days of senior thesis research every week. The final project, "Connecting for Good: Bridging the Digital Divide Through Effective Integration Policies", focused on disparities on access to technology among different parts of the city and combined empirical research with in-person interviews from volunteer work as a Computer Science assistant in an elementary school in New York City.
