# Overview

[Game Idea Generator][game-idea-generator] was a side project I started while studying at Make School. It's an iOS app that creates random game ideas composed of several predetermined phrases.

This is the future of gamingâ€”at your finger tips.

The generator works by first deciding on a game genre, then a player concept. (The player concept is comprised of a noun and some descriptor.) Finally, it comes up with a purpose for the player, which is comprised of a verb and a noun.

You can download Game Idea Generator from the App Store [here][game-idea-generator].
