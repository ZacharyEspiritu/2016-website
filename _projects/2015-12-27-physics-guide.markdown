Immediately following Christmas Break, all Regis High School students are required to take a Science Mid-Year Exam covering all of the material in their respective science class from the past half-year. However, over the break, I didn’t want to study for my Physics exam, but I wanted to learn LaTeX, so I made a website about Physics using LaTeX.

Using [MathJax][mathjax-website], a Javascript integration for LaTeX rendering on webpages, I built a website covering all of the topics that were going to be on the exam with LaTeX for displaying necessary formulas and example solution sets for extra practice.

The results were conclusive: 100% of people surveyed agreed that they scored higher on the exam because of the website.<sup>*</sup>

<sup>*Disclaimer: 100% of people surveyed also agreed that they had no basis of comparison for their exam scores.</sup>

You can find the website [here][physics-midyear-guide].
