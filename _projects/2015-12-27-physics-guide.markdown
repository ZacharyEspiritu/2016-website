# Overview

Immediately following Christmas Break, all Regis High School students are required to take a Science Mid-Year Exam covering all of the material in their respective science class from the past half-year. Obviously, I didn’t want to study for my Physics exam, but I *did* want to learn LaTeX, so I made [a website about Physics][physics-midyear-guide] using LaTeX.

Using [MathJax][mathjax-website], a Javascript integration for LaTeX rendering on webpages, I built a website covering all of the topics that were going to be on the exam with LaTeX for displaying necessary formulas and example solution sets for extra practice. I also used Sketch to design a cute, little mascot to cheer people on while they were studying.

The results were conclusive: 100% of people surveyed agreed that they scored higher on the exam because of the website.<sup>*</sup>

<sup>*Disclaimer: 100% of people surveyed also agreed that they had no basis of comparison for their exam scores.</sup>

You can find the website [here][physics-midyear-guide].
