At the health-themed [hackTrin III][hackTrin], I teamed up with [Nicholas Cimaszewski][nc-github] and [Vincent McAuliffe][vm-github] to create FitFarm, a fitness-based farm management game where players raise their own farm through real-world exercise.

The app tracks players' steps in real-life using HealthKit, and converts those steps on a 1:1 ratio to in-game currency named CardioCoins (we really liked alliteration) that can be used to buy supplies for their personal farm akin to the game Farmville.

### Implementation

I programmed the majority of the app in Swift, with some Objective-C bridged over in order to implement `HKHealthStore`, Apple's API for accessing data from HealthKit. I also worked with Nick to design and source the art assets, and Vincent made a landing page for the app, which you can find [here][fitfarm-website].

Intrepid readers will notice the similarities between FitFarm and [Data Farm][data-farm-post], another project I've worked on, though they'll also notice from the screenshots that we were able to actually create a prototype with basic game mechanics working as opposed to just a proof of concept of the data tracking mechanism.

Over 8 hours of hacking, 75% of the time was spent figuring out how to actually integrate HealthKit into our application. (Turns out that requesting permissions to access a client's HealthKit data is the first step to resolving all your problems.)

### Result

After an open demo round where all the participating teams were allowed to present, we won 3rd place at the hackathon!
