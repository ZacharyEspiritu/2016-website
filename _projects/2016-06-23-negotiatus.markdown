In the summer of 2016, I worked with Negotiatus as a Software Engineering Intern.

- Engineered several web scrapers with natural language processing capabilities to automate proprietary processes covered by NDA, saving hundreds of hours of human labor.
- Co-developed automated test suite from scratch for over 7000 lines of code with over 70% coverage.
- Developed cron-like system where clients can schedule recurring orders, leading to increased expected monthly revenue.
- Created a modular, user-facing notification system allowing notifications associated with any database object to be sent to any user with a single line of code.
- Built several HTML email templates and integrated them with previous plain text system.
