I was commissioned by two of my friends at Regis to design the website for [Mental Health Matters][mhm-website], a blog dedicated to raising awareness of mental health issues in New York City.

You can visit the website [here][mhm-website]. The website is fully responsive on mobile as well, if you're into that sort of thing.

This project was also an opportunity to experiment delivering production websites from Heroku with external AWS S3 buckets for data storage for the first time.
