# Overview

For the final project of the <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1230/">CSCI1230: Introduction to Computer Graphics</a> course at Brown University, I worked with <a href="https://github.com/wizardofcos">Michael Cosgrove</a> to develop "Snowy Sunrise", a real-time GPU raymarched scene featuring L-systems, screen-space volumetric lighting, and fast-approximate anti-aliasing.

I was responsible for implementing both the volumetric lighting effect and fast-approximate anti-aliasing.

# Render Pipeline

Our program uses three main shaders:

1. A raymarching shader, which renders the scene (both the landscape and the trees) to two render targets: a texture containing the normal, raymarched scene and an "occlusion texture", where all objects in the raymarched scene are rendered black with the light source as a white circle. (Originally, we had two separate raymarches for the occlusion texture and the normal scene---however, we were able to significantly optimize the performance of our program by combining them into a single shader with multiple render targets.)

2. A volumetric lighting shader, which takes samples from the occlusion texture in a radial fashion to simulate light rays shining across the screen. This shader then additively blends the light ray samples with the original texture to achieve the desired lighting effect.

3. A FXAA shader, which performs edge detection on the texture returned by the volumetric lighting shader and applies an anti-aliasing effect to those edges.
